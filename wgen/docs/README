Notes on wgen2
Mutahar Chalmers, December 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wgen2 is a fundamental rebuild of my first stochastic weather generator. The 
idea is to make all the significant changes that have been identified at 
various times to make this code optimal, scalable to the whole world, and as 
correct as possible. The main changes implemented include:

1 Read and write Parquet format files as standard for all weather data.     [X]

2 Separate weather input files by variable (instead of a single hist.h5).   [X] 

3 Convert all references from 'geoid' to 'qid', reflecting my preferred     [X]
  geocoding convention for gridded data.

4 Apply root-cosine weighting to cells at latitudes remote from the         [X]
  equator to reflect their reduced area, and therefore their reduced
  contribution to the covariance matrix. See link below.

5 Exclude cells which have extremely low normality in a given season        [ ]
  (usually because they have lots of zero-precipitation occurrences)
  from the PCA calculation since they detract from the overall quality
  of the EOFs and PCs.

6 When generating stochastic weather, write only seasonal data together
  with analogue mapping; this not only saves disk space but also allows us
  to use different season-to-day disaggregation methods.                    [ ]

7 Add hierarchical/nested PCA: do PCA at a 'global' level and then at a 
  regional level, and link the PCs somehow {talk to Anongnart}.             [ ]

8 Generally simplify the code and make it more efficient.                   [ ]


NB: Changes which would fundamentally change the structure of the
    methodology include:

    a. Go back to treating seasons as 'groups of similar months' instead of
       'aggregated single seasonal values'

    b. Steve Jewson's approach - do (multiple) regression on a cell-by-cell
       basis against various climate indices, smooth the regression
       coefficients and then do PCA on the residuals. Not sure how this would
       work but it definitely has promise. This might form the basis for
       a future major upgrade.
